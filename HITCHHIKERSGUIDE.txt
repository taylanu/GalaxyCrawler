Dev Guide:
In game, there are many variables that go into play, most of which are coordinates for each of the in game objects (ie. the player and the enemies and the player's missiles)

MX and MY are missile coordinates and can be found when checking for collisions and when they are drawn with a drawLine command among other instances.
